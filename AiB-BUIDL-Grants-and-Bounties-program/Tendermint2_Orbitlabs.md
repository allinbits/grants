## Team Qualifications

Our team is uniquely qualified to contribute to Tendermint2 due to our extensive experience in blockchain development and distributed systems:

- **Proven expertise in Cosmos SDK, IBC, and CometBFT**, with hands-on experience developing and maintaining Layer 1 blockchains such as Whitewhale, Composable, and Quicksilver.

- **Strong proficiency in Golang and Rust**, with our engineers collectively possessing over 12 years of experience in developing highly scalable backend services and distributed systems using Golang.

- **Successful track record of implementing critical blockchain modules**, including handling chain halt issues during upgrade processes.

- **Direct experience with Layer 1 blockchain development**, exemplified by our work on the EVM-compatible, Cosmos SDK-based Astra Protocol, which involved creating a blockchain explorer and implementing cross-chain bridges. https://github.com/AstraProtocol

- **Contributions to open-source projects** across the Ethereum, Cosmos, and Solana ecosystems, demonstrating our commitment to collaborative blockchain development.

- **Expertise in smart contract development and blockchain interoperability protocols**, gained through our work on various blockchain platforms.

- **Strong background in large-scale distributed systems and microservices architecture**, crucial for understanding and enhancing Tendermint2's design principles.

- **Demonstrated ability to enhance documentation and conduct comprehensive code reviews**, leveraging our extensive experience as senior engineers in traditional programming environments.

- **Experience in optimizing blockchain performance**, implementing consensus mechanisms, and ensuring robust testing practices.

This diverse skill set and practical experience in blockchain development, particularly within the Cosmos ecosystem, positions our team to make significant and impactful contributions to the Tendermint2 project.
