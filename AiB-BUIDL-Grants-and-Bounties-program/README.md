# ReadME: AiB BUIDL Grants and Bounties Program

## AiB BUIDL Grants and Bounties Program

The objective of this program is to provide financial support to teams and individuals who are actively contributing to the development of the proposed [AtomOne Chain](https://github.com/atomone-hub/genesis) and related software. Grants under this program range between $3,000 - $8,000 per month depending on the application, with a streamlined submission and evaluation process that ensure quick decisions. The AiB BUIDL Grants and Bounties program is funded by All in Bits with the AiB core engineering team members serving as the reviewers of all grants within the program.

This program might be a good fit if **any** of the following apply to you:

- You are an independent blockchain software developer, or a Go Developer or you are actively making commits on AtomOne Github or the Gaia fork, or are interested in AtomOne

This program’s mission is to encourage the members of the AiB contributor community to become active participants in the building and growth of the proposed AtomOne ecosystem.

- Deliverables will be specific to dedicated focus areas.
- The builder needs to cohesively explain their proposed solutions and commit to report publicly on the outcomes.
- All applications must start with a well written draft specification. It does not need to be complete, but it must be simple yet demonstrate competency and understanding of the problem.

Please note our [Terms and Conditions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WCZSLTYcaOHpLs-nxBD5SN1uLTuqhRPb7a9O7y-08mQ/edit) for the grant prior to application.

## Areas of focus for grants:

Here are the list of focus areas the grantee can choose to contribute to, but other contributions not mentioned here may be worked on as well:

### Tendermint/Tendermint2 IBC compatibility

- **Context**: The primary goal is to port the IBC module to Tendermint2 and to demonstrate compatibility between Tendermint1 and Tendermint2 chains.
- **Resources**:
  - [https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go) (cosmos-sdk IBC)
  - [https://github.com/gnolang/gno/tree/master/tm2](https://github.com/gnolang/gno/tree/master/tm2) (Tendermint2)
- **Expected Deliverables(one of)**:
  - Working proof of concept of Tendermint <> Tendermint2 IBC bridge
  - Survey of changes to Tendermint2 that affect IBC
  - IBC and relayer related tooling
  - Specification documents

### AtomOne Validator Selection and ICS Crypto-Economics

**Context**: AtomOne will change the validator delegation algorithm to make validators more equal in voting power. This will increase the nakamoto coefficient of the AtomOne hub, and also make the current version of ICS (partial set security PSS) more reasonable in security. For now, assume that the initial ICS (inter-chain security) that AtomOne will support is a modified version of PSS. After, we will consider simple replicated security where all validators need to validate. Also keep in mind, we will change hub governance so that proposals don’t take delegation into account, to reduce the power of validators relative to the stakers, who can vote themselves.

The crypto-economic challenge that arises is that there needs to be a way to dis-incentivize the delegation of validators once it has already acquired the delegation needed for it to be a hub validator. It may be sufficient to distribute the hub rewards going to validators equally among the validators, such that delegators that delegate to a validator with already high delegation would see less rewards than delegating to lesser delegated validators, but this isn’t great for the early delegators, nor fair for self-delegation. Also, this doesn’t guarantee that “tail validators” have much at stake, so there probably needs to be a minimum staking requirement. When a validator gets slashed, probably all delegators should get slashed equally pro-rata, regardless of excess delegation.

It might make sense to consider a limited range of validator inequality for hub security; a validator with the most delegation might receive at most twice as much hub voting power on the hub as a validator with the least delegation, and also twice as much total hub rewards. This would allow some flexibility in delegation choice. But this is not strictly required.

With PSS, there is the issue that a validator that doesn’t have much stake behind it may end up validating for too many ICS consumer chains, thereby diluting the effectiveness of proof of stake security. In the long run we should consider the stake behind validators to be potential capital that can be used to reimburse victims of theft from validator malice. So PSS should probably be modified to limit how many consumer shards a validator may opt to validate for.

PSS earned rewards should primarily be distributed among the validators participating in the consumer chain (and these rewards are conceptually separate from hub rewards), but some portion should be redistributed to the AtomOne hub as hub rewards, so as to incentivize more equal validators. In the long run, we want AtomOne validators to be operating more or less equally secure data-centers with similar capacity.

We may remove the per-validator custom commission rate and rather apply a global effective commission rate. The commission rate is not the best means of control, and it can change too quickly after delegation resulting in a type of rug. Instead of per-validator commission rates, the overall validator selection and reward algorithm should incentivize proper distribution of delegation among the validators.

In the end, what we want is a validator selection algorithm and hub/PSS/ICS reward algorithm that gives flexibility to validators for more permissionless validation of consumer shards, while also subsidizing the growth of tail validators, to ensure the sustainable growth of more or less equal capacity validators in the long run. The algorithm must also be practical in terms of computation.

**Expected Deliverables (one of)**

- An english written specification proposal
- Crypto-economic justifications for above specification.

### AtomOne Interchain Security (ICS) Containerization and Orchestration

**Context:** AtomeOne’s ICS will initially be a fork of the current ICS (Inter-chain security) implementation in Cosmos (Partial Set Security, PSS), permissionless yet more sustainable for validators and secure for consumers than the current version. Afterwards we will also consider simple replicated security where all validators must validate; this will be used for necessary core-shards, while the permissionless system is better suited for consumer chains.

For both cases, we want the deployment of consumer shards (and later, core shards) to be as simple as possible, and the best way to achieve this is through something like linux container images. The container image would speak ABCI, and be paired with a standard consensus engine managed by AtomOne. That is, the consumer shard should not handle consensus, or P2P networking; all it does is receive transactions from ABCI and compute state changes for the consumer chain application. If the consumer provided an application image that also included a custom consensus engine, it would be impossible for AtomOne to hold validators to account.

We need several things to make this all work, but first we want to choose a specific containerization technology. The technology chosen should be minimal and auditable; this excludes technologies like Docker, but it may use the technologies that Docker uses under the hood. Whatever we end up using, we want to commit to a standard that can be maintained in the long run.

We also need improvements to the ABCI specification and the consensus engine to handle additional message types and logic that is necessary for our model of ICS. For example, validator set changes should not originate from the application, but rather they should originate from the hub, and all PSS consumer shards and the chosen validators should be represented on the hub. We can assume that all PSS consumer shards’ consensus engine instance (e.g. Tendermint or Tendermint2) has privileged RPC access to read the state of the hub.

We also need corresponding custom AtomOne orchestration software that validators can use to automate the scaling of validation services to additional consumer shards. Strictly speaking AtomOne PSS may not require the usage of this orchestration software, and validators may choose to manually onboard new consumer chains, but in the long run everything will become automated and standardized.

### Tendermint2

**Context:** Tendermint2 is a fork of TendermintCore designed with principles that emphasize simplicity of design, minimal code footprint, and minimal dependencies. All dependencies are audited and included in the repository, and components are made modular wherever reasonable. The goal is to achieve completeness within a reasonable timeframe, reducing vulnerabilities and ensuring the software is finished and robust.
